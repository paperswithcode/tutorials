Basic guidance on how to contribute to Papers with Code

### Adding Results on Papers with Code

1. In order to add results first create an account on [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/). 

2. We encourage results from published papers from either a conference, journal or preprints like ArXiv. However, it's also possible to include results from GitHub repositories where results are documented and reproducible. 

3. There are different ways you can add results to a paper. You can click on the "Edit" button from the corresponding paper page and an interface will pop up (image below). That's the easy way to add results:

In some occassions, you will not get the add results interface. But you can still add results using this **second option**. First, you will need to add a task on the paper page:

The task is required for this second way of adding result as it is a required field in the form that will pop up. Then you go to the "Edit" button and you will see a pop up like below:

Ensure you include all the information that's requested in the form. 

A **third way** of adding results is to do it directly from the benchmark interface. Assuming you already identified this existing leaderboard, you can click on the "Edit Leaderboard" button, and add the results as a row to the table. You are required to add model name, paper, result, etc.
