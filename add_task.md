6) Before adding a new task, ensure that it doesn't yet exist by trying a search in the **Add** input box. Sometimes the task may exist under a different name. Try to search for synonyms as well. If you are confident the task doesn't exist, add the details for your new task in the form that appears.

Tip: A good task should be specific enough and have a clear description.
